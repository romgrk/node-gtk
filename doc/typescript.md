# TypeScript

node-gtk can generate TypeScript declarations for the libraries you use,
straight from the GObject-Introspection typelibs installed on your machine — so
the types always match your actual library versions and node-gtk's own runtime
shape (camelCase methods, signal callbacks, nullability, etc.).

```sh
# generates ./node_modules/.node-gtk-types (a hidden, git-ignored cache)
npx node-gtk generate-types Gtk-4.0 Adw-1
```

The command emits one declaration file per namespace (plus the full dependency
closure) and a `node-gtk.d.ts` shim. Point your `tsconfig.json` at it:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "paths": { "node-gtk": ["./node_modules/.node-gtk-types/node-gtk.d.ts"] }
  }
}
```

Then `gi.require` is fully typed — the namespace is inferred from the string
arguments:

```ts
import * as gi from 'node-gtk'

const Gtk = gi.require('Gtk', '4.0')   // typed as the Gtk-4.0 namespace
const win = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow({ title: 'Hello', defaultWidth: 400 })
win.on('close-request', () => false)   // signal name + callback are typed
```

The [direct `gi:` import form](./importing.md) is typed too — the generated
shim declares each `gi:<Namespace>-<version>` module, so its default export is the
namespace:

```ts
import Gtk from 'gi:Gtk-4.0'           // typed as the Gtk-4.0 namespace
const win = new Gtk.ApplicationWindow({ title: 'Hello', defaultWidth: 400 })
```

You get typed constructor properties (including inherited and interface ones),
camelCase methods with real return types, GI nullability, typed signal
overloads, enums, `bigint` for 64-bit integers, out-parameters surfaced as the
return value, and cross-namespace types. GNOME's API documentation is included
as JSDoc (with `@param`/`@returns`), so editors show it on hover — this reads the
`.gir` files installed by the libraries' `-dev`/`-devel` packages; pass
`--no-docs` for leaner output if they aren't installed or you don't want them.

Because the output is a generated cache under `node_modules`, add a `postinstall`
script so it regenerates on install:

```json
{ "scripts": { "postinstall": "node-gtk generate-types Gtk-4.0 Adw-1" } }
```

Run `npx node-gtk generate-types --help` for options.
